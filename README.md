## Introduction

For this project, Iâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of my recent bank transactions, among other features.

The instructions below will walk I through the process of ideation and planning my app: deciding on my user interface, planning how the information will be laid out on the page, etc. I should work through all the planning steps before I start doing any coding.

## Requirements

For this project, I must:

1. Have a well-written README file.
2. Fetch data from a local server running JSON DB server.

## Project Setup & Pre-requisite Data

1. In my project directory, create a db.json file and use this dataLinks to an external site. for my server DB.
2. Run this command to get the backend started: json-server --watch db.json
3. Test my server by visiting this route in the browser: http://localhost:8001/transactions

### Project Setup

Once I have the plan in place for the application I want to build take the following steps:

1. Create a new project folder.
2. Create a new GitHub repository (NB: ENSURE IT IS PRIVATE).
3. Add TM as a contributor to the project. (This is only for grading purposes. We promise we won't steal my code)
4. Please make sure I regularly commit to the repository.

### Project Guidelines

my project should conform to the following set of guidelines:

### Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

1. See a table of all transactions.
2. Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new transaction to the table * the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend *
3. Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

## Bonus Deliverables

These bonus deliverables are here for extra challenge and won't affect score. Make sure to commit my work to save my progress before attempting the bonus deliverables!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.

- Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table
